            <div class="col-11 col-sm-10 col-lg-6 def-descrp">
                <p>At the beginning of your career in digital, it's important to think about the foundations you're laying: are you building the right connections that may help you in the future, and getting exposure to a variety of experiences?</p>
                <p>We believe the network you build in your career is vital: after all, who knows what opportunities it might lead to? When you join us, you aren’t part of a faceless grad intake. You’re part of a Club - literally, becoming a key part of a 100-strong network of ANDis. You’ll build important relationships in this close-knit environment where your achievements and impact are highly visible, which can really help to accelerate your progression.</p>
                <p>One of the other great advantages of starting your career at AND is the diversity of our work. You’ll get to hone your tech and product skills, gaining invaluable experiences across a wide range of projects. This gives you a solid foundation for your future career in tech.</p>

                <p>Technology offers a diverse and rewarding variety of career options, but not every graduate who joins us has everything locked down and mapped out. That’s ok. Graduates at AND can explore both analyst and developer pathways before picking one.</p>

                <p>When you start at AND, you join one of our award-winning Bootcamps, and spend three weeks learning everything from our values and culture, to Agile methodologies and Scrum Master training.</p>

                <p>You’ll also work in small teams for two five-day sprints on your first Build project: it’s like an internal hackathon, where you’ll work together to solve a particular brief.</p>

                <p>The Bootcamp ends with a presentation of what you have achieved during the Build project, after which you’ll head off to celebrate the end of your first three weeks at AND.</p>

                        <p>To get a sense of where you’re at, skillswise, we next send you an online test to complete in your own time. Take your time and, when you’re ready, send it back over for review.</p>

                <h3>An internship that counts</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-11 col-sm-10 col-lg-6 def-descrp">
                <p>We hear you. The first year of uni is done, and already that question is getting asked by everyone from your mum to great uncle Gerald: “So, what are you going to do after university?”</p>

                <p>Finding the right internship while you are studying can really help you find the answer. But more often that not, an internship involves a lot of shadowing, and not much hands-on learning.</p>

                <p>Internships at AND are different. We offer real exposure to the industry, through a 12-month placement for penultimate year students. On this intensive programme, you will:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Work on active projects with real clients.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Benefit from a wide schedule of training courses that we run every week, alongside other ANDis from across the organisation.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Be part of a close-knit team, with support from your squad lead and peers.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Be taught languages and technologies you haven’t yet been exposed to at uni.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>And, at the end, you have the opportunity to join AND as a full-time graduate on completion of your studies.</p>
