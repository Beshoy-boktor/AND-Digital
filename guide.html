Routinely, we see these transformation efforts fail and companies struggle to gain real value from innovation efforts. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-11 col-sm-10 col-lg-6 def-descrp">
            <p>We bring together experienced practitioners from a variety of disciplines to take a close look at the challenges facing your business - from technology to people, data to culture. This wide-angle perspective provides a richer, fuller picture of just what it will take to accelerate your digital capabilities, and create the right environment and internal conditions for success.</p>

                    <span class="bolded-word">PRODUCT</span>
                    <p>A digital product today needs to be more than ‘good’: it needs to be right. We focus on defining exactly what ‘right’ means - for your business, and your users - and establishing effective product management to give you confidence that products are funded, built and iterated appropriately.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="bolded-word">TECHNOLOGY</span>
                    <p>The technology ecosystem that powers your business is as unique as a fingerprint, and ensuring it’s fit-for-purpose is a continuous process. AND’s technologists and engineers architect practical solutions to your most complex tech challenges - optimising for today, and ensuring you’re ready for tomorrow.</p>

                <li>
                    <span class="bolded-word">PEOPLE</span>
                    <p>Success in digital is dependent on your ability to build high performing teams. With specialists in organisational design and talent development, we focus on understanding the culture and environment in which your teams operate, identifying ways to progressively adapt both for optimum results.</p>

                <li>
                    <span class="bolded-word">DELIVERY</span>
                    <p>Breakthrough success requires discipline in delivery. Appropriate methods and techniques are key - but there’s no one-size-fits-all: what works for one organisation may not work for another. With a pragmatic eye, we help you learn, adopt, and adapt the practices you really need to succeed.</p>

                    <span class="bolded-word">INSIGHT</span>
                    <p>Companies today generate enormous quantities of data - but knowing how to translate raw insights into outsized competitive advantage is another thing entirely. We work with in-house teams to put actionable data at the heart of your transformation agenda - from setup, to ongoing measurement and analysis. </p>
