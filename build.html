            <p>At the heart of every AND club are our cross-functional squads, comprised of experienced engineers, UX designers, analysts, architects and product specialists. Together, there is nothing we love more than solving tricky challenges with technology and helping organisations build out their own digital capabilities. Crucially, it’s our commitment to this last that makes AND a little different - we don’t build for you: we build with you.</p>
            <p>That way, your teams increase their skill level and their independence so that one day, you may not need us at all. Or anyone else, for that matter - which is when we know we’ve done our very best work.</p>
